# Your Final Submission involves Three Parts

1. **The Report** You will submit a report in both R Markdown and either HTML or PDF addressing all of the issues described in the Data Development and Analytic Tasks.

2. **The Video** You will produce a video in the mp4 format of no more than 3 minutes in length if you're working alone, and of no more than 5 minutes in length between you if you are working in a pair. In this video, you will describe what you believe to be the most important findings for your choice of two of the four analyses you will complete. 
    - If you are working in a pair, each of you will present one of the two analyses. 
    - Your video must include your face (so recording in Zoom is preferable) and must share graphs and results taken from the report you build. 
    - The video must stand on its own, in the sense that it must be completely understandable to someone who has not read your report, but who is generally familiar with County Health Rankings and its measurements.

3. **The Self-Evaluation** You will each (whether working alone or with a partner) submit a brief self-evaluation via a Google Form Dr. Love will make available.

All three elements are due on 2020-10-20 at Noon.
