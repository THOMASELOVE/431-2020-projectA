## Your Final Submission involves Three Parts

1. **The Report** You will submit a polished report in both R Markdown and either HTML or PDF addressing all of the issues described in the Data Development and Analytic Tasks.

2. **The Video** You will produce a video in the mp4 format of no more than 3 minutes in length if you're working alone, and of no more than 5 minutes in length between you if you are working in a pair. In this video, you will describe what you believe to be the most important findings for your choice of two of the three analytic tasks you have completed, while explaining your process of cleaning and managing the data as much as you believe is necessary for people to understand and evaluate your conclusions.
    - If you are working alone on the project, begin your presentation by introducing yourself and describing your sample (which states you used and specifying the research questions you'll be addressing in your discussion.)
    - If you are working in a pair, each of you will present one of the two analyses, either in two separate videos (which combined are no more than 5 minutes long) or in one video. In either case, introduce yourself at the start of your portion of the video, and specify the states you used (even though you and your partner will be using the same states) and the research question you'll be addressing.
    - Your video must include your face (so recording in Zoom is preferable) and must share graphs and results taken from the report you build.
    - All videos should include a clear statement of the research questions for any analyses presented, and justify the responses to those questions with results from the analyses.
    - The video must stand on its own, in the sense that it must be completely understandable to someone who has not read your report, but who is generally familiar with County Health Rankings and its measurements. You need to tell us everything we need to know to evaluate your claims, and no more.

3. **The Self-Evaluation** You will each (whether working alone or with a partner) submit a brief self-evaluation via a Google Form Dr. Love will make available before 2020-10-16. The form should take about 10 minutes to complete.

All three elements are due on Friday **2020-10-30 at 5 PM**. Note the changed deadline.

### Grading

- Project A is graded on a scale from 0 to 100, although I expect the highest grade to be close to 95. Dr. Love works with the TAs to provide feedback and grade the projects, but the final Project A grade is determined solely by him.
    - As we've seen previously, the Proposal is worth (up to) 25 points. Many students will score 25 points, and we expect most students to score at least 20.
- The Report is worth 40 points. It is unlikely that anyone will score above 37 points, which is the planned score for a completely accurate and polished report. Most scores will likely fall between 25 and 35 points on this element.
    - The most important parts of the Report are accurate (and effectively presented) data development, accurate (and effectively presented) analyses, and the appropriateness of your research questions and your responses to them in light of your analyses.
- The Video is worth 25 points. It is unlikely that anyone will score above 23 points, which is the planned score for a very strong presentation, which is clear to see and hear and which is effective. Most scores will likely fall between 16 and 22 points on this element.
    - All videos should include a clear statement of the research questions for any analyses presented, and justify the responses to those questions with results from the analyses.
- The Self-Evaluation is worth 10 points. Most people who complete the self-evaluation thoughtfully will receive the full 10 points.

Overall, a project score of 85 or higher is regarded as an A, and a score of 70 to 84 is regarded as a B. Project grading is set up to generate a median score near 84.

### Hint: More isn't better.

To improve your grade, perform the elements of the data science cycle (ingestion, tidying, transforming, visualizing, modeling and communicating) more effectively. Presenting work that isn't relevant to addressing the issues in question will not help your grade.

A stronger grade will be associated with doing the tasks we've discussed more effectively. Adding a lot of additional and unnecessary analyses/work without editing down to the important issues will not improve your grade, but rather have the opposite effect. We want to see polished, accurate, clear work. Making things clearer is the hardest thing to do, and so it's the thing that impresses us most.
